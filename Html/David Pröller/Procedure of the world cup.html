        <h1>Procedure of the world cup</h1><br>
        <p>In the world cup there are 32 countries that all have to go through a qualifying system in order to play in the world cup.</p>
        <P>There are 8 groups with 4 countries each and the first 2 qualify for the knockout stage.</P><br>
        <h2>Group stage</h2><br>
        <p>Everyone plays once against everyone in the group stage and the 2 countries with the most points go through.</p>
        <p>A match is 90 minutes long and the team who scored the most goals after 90 minutes gets 3 points for the win.</p>
        <p>The country who did not score the most goals lost the game and gets 0 points.</p>
        <p>If 2 countires score the same amount of goals they both get 1 point for a draw.</p>
        <div class="PointSystem">
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <tr>
                <th colspan="3">Point system</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Win</td>
                <td>3 points</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Draw</td>
                <td>1 points</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lose</td>
                <td>0 points</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </div>
        <p>If 2 countries have the same amount of points then the winner of the direct duel goes through.</p>
        <p>If they also drawn against each other the team with the most goals goes trough.</p><br>
        <h3>Knockout stage</h3><br>
        <img src="Turnierbaum.png" alt="Picture of the knockout stage format" width="691,2" height="388,8">
        <p>When a country comes first in the group they will play against a second place from another group.</p>
        <p>A first place can not play against another first place and a second place can not play against another first place.</p>
        <p>The system also doesnt allow two teams from the same group to play against eachother a second time before the final.</p>
