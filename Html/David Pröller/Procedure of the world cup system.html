        <h1>Procedure of the world cup</h1><br>
        <p>In the world cup there are 32 countries that all have to go through a qualifying system in order to play in the world cup.</p>
        <P>There are 8 groups with 4 countries each and the first 2 qualify for the knockout stage.</P><br><br>
        <h2>Group stage</h2><br>
        <p>Everyone plays once against everyone in the group stage and the 2 countries with the most points go through.</p>
        <p>A match is 90 minutes long and the team who scored the most goals after 90 minutes gets 3 points for the win.</p>
        <p>The country who did not score the most goals lost the game and gets 0 points.</p>
        <p>If 2 countires score the same amount of goals they both get 1 point for a draw.</p>
        <div class="PointSystem">
        <table id="pointsystem" class="table table-bordered">
            <tr>
                <th colspan="2">Point system</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Win</td>
                <td>3 points</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Draw</td>
                <td>1 points</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lose</td>
                <td>0 points</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </div>
        <p>If 2 countries have the same amount of points then the winner of the direct duel goes through.</p>
        <p>If they also drawn against each other the team with the most goals goes trough.</p><br><br>

        <h2>Knockout stage</h2><br>
        <p>When a country comes first in the group they will play against a second place from another group.</p>
        <p>A first place can not play against another first place and a second place can not play against another first place.</p>
        <p>The system also doesnt allow two teams from the same group to play against eachother a second time before the final.</p>
        <p>The system is not the same system as in the group stage. There is no system with points. The winner just gets through.</p>
        <p>The country with the most goals after 90 minutes goes instant through into the next round and the country who lost can go home.</p>
        <p>If 2 countries have the same amount of goals after 90 minutes there is no draw like in the knockout stage.</p>
        <p>They have to play it out in extra time and if they have the same amount of goals after extra time they have to go to penaltys.</p>
        <p>Every country that lost in the knockout stage has to fly home.</p>
        <p>If you lose in the semi-final you have one game left. The game about the third place also called little final.</p><br><br>
        <a class="WorldCupTrophy" href="worldcuptrophy.jpg"><img src="worldcuptrophy.jpg" alt="WorldCup Trophy" width="436,3636" height="245,4545"/></a>
        <h2>Final</h2><br>
        <p>Then there is the big final where the two winner of the two semi-finals play against each other.</p>
        <p>The winner of the world cup final gets 38 million dollar and the second place gets 28 million dollar.</p>
        <p>After the final not only the winner gets the world cup trophy, also the player with the most goals </p>
        <p>in the tournament gets a trophy, the best goalkeeper and the best player of the tournament gets a trophy.</p>
