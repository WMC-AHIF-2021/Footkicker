        <br>
        <h2>Submit your own tip</h2>

            <tr>
                <th>tipped game result</th>
                <th id="listCenter">Footkicker coins</th>
            </tr>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>You can click on a game you want and then you can type in your result as you think they are playing.</p>
        <p>After you have submitted your own tip, the game will be simulated an the result is displayed.</p>
        <p>This allows you to see whether the team you have bet on has won with your score or you have submitted a wrong tip.</p>

        <p>The reward will be some footkicker coins which you can see at the end of the world cup</p>
        <p>how well you have tipped and you can compare your results with other people.</p>
