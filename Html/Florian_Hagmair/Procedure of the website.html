        <h1>Procedure of the game</h1>
        <p>Here you will be explained how the game works and what procedure the main website has.</p>
        <p>First there is an introduction at the top, what the idea of this website is and what we want to achieve with it.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The website '<a href="./History.html">History</a>' writes about the history of all world cups before.</p>
        <p>It is written when the first world cup started and in which country.</p>
        <p>There is listed the winner and the top scorer of each world cup.</p>
        <p>It is also written about the favourit teams and about the records set.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Procedure of the world cup system</h2>
        <p>The website '<a href="./Procedure of the world cup system.html">Procedure of the world cup system</a>' writes about the system of a world cup.</p>
        <p>There is explained how the group stage system works and how the points are distributed after a win, a lose or a draw.</p>
        <p>The question is answerd how many teams are playing and how many teams in each groups are.</p>
        <p>Also it is written about the system of the knockout round and the rules.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After all these pages the tree of the world cup is listed and there are some nice informations.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Tree of the world cup</h2>
        <p>The tree of the world cup is a overview with the whole groups and their teams.</p>
        <p>This way you can see perfectly which country is with whom in a group.</p>
        <p>A nice feature is that you can click on any team you want and then you will get the country's squad.</p>
        <p>Then the game begins. First you can see all game encounters and then you can submit your own tip for this game.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Submit your own tip</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>tipped game result</th>
                <th id="listCenter">Footkicker coins</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>correct</td>
                <td id="listCenter">5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>one goal away</td>
                <td id="listCenter">3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>false but team correct</td>
                <td id="listCenter">1</dt>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>false and team false</td>
                <td id="listCenter">0</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>You can click on a game you want and then you can type in your result as you think they are playing.</p>
        <p>After you have submitted your own tip, the game will be simulated an the result is displayed.</p>
        <p>This allows you to see whether the team you have bet on has won with your score or you have submitted a wrong tip.</p>
        <p>If you have made a correct tip and you team has won, you will receive a reward.</p>
        <p>The reward will be some footkicker coins which you can see at the end of the world cup</p>
        <p>how well you have tipped and you can compare your results with other people.</p>
        <p>The number of footkicker coins you get depends on various factors.</p>
