            <h2>When starts the WM</h2>
            <p> The first World Cup took place in 1930. Before the first World Cup, the Olympic Games were the most important international football tournament, although <br> 
                there were tournaments before, the first official recognition by the International Olympic Committee took place through the inclusion of football in the Olympic <br> 
                sports at the Games in 1900. 
                The fathers of the World Cup are the then FIFA President, Jules Rimet, and the President of the French Football Association, Henri <br>
                Delaunay. The official decision  to host a "World Cup" was made on 28 May 1928 at the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam. The first World Cup was attended by <br> 
                13 nations: uruguay, Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, France, Yugoslavia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Romania and the USA. The first matches took <br>
                place simultaneously and ended with a 4-1 victory by France over Mexico and a 3-1 victory by the USA against Belgium.
