      <h1><strong>Procedure of the world cup system</strong></h1>
<p>In the world cup there are 32 countries that all have to go through a qualifying system in order to play in the world cup.
    There are 8 groups with 4 countries each and the first 2 qualify for the knockout stage.
</p><br>

<h2>Group stage</h2>
<p>Everyone plays once against everyone in the group stage and the 2 countries with the most points go through.
    A match is 90 minutes long and the team who scored the most goals after 90 minutes gets 3 points for the win.
    The country who did not score the most goals lost the game and gets 0 points.
    If 2 countires score the same amount of goals they both get 1 point for a draw.
    If 2 countries have the same amount of points then the winner of the direct duel goes through.
    If they also drawn against each other the team with the most goals goes trough.</p><br><br>
<table id="pointSystem" class="table table-bordered">
    <tr>
        <th colspan="2" id="center">Point system</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="center">Win</td>
        <td id="center">3 points</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="center">Draw</td>
        <td id="center">1 points</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id="center">Lose</td>
        <td id="center">0 points</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Knockout stage</h2>
<p>When a country comes first in the group they will play against a second place from another group.
    A first place can not play against another first place and a second place can not play against another first place.
    The system also doesnt allow two teams from the same group to play against eachother a second time before the final.
    The system is not the same system as in the group stage. There is no system with points. The winner just gets through.
    The country with the most goals after 90 minutes goes instant through into the next round and the country who lost can go home.
</p>
<p id="allSideP">
    If 2 countries have the same amount of goals after 90 minutes there is no draw like in the knockout stage.
    They have to play it out in extra time and if they have the same amount of goals after extra time they have to go to penaltys.
    Every country that lost in the knockout stage has to fly home.
    If you lose in the semi-final you have one game left. The game about the third place also called little final.
</p>

<h2>Final</h2>
<p>Then there is the big final where the two winner of the two semi-finals play against each other.
    The winner of the world cup final gets 38 million dollar and the second place gets 28 million dollar.
    After the final not only the winner gets the world cup trophy, also the player with the most goals
    in the tournament gets a trophy, the best goalkeeper and the best player of the tournament gets a trophy.
