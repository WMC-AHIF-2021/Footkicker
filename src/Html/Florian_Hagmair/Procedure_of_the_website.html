      <h2>Tree of the world cup</h2>
      <p>The tree of the world cup is a overview with the whole groups and their teams.
      This way you can see perfectly which country is with whom in a group.
      A nice feature is that you can click on any team you want and then you will get the country's squad with all players.
      Then the game begins. First you can see all game encounters and then you can submit your own tip for each game.</p>
      <br>
      <table>
          <tr>
              <th>tipped game result</th>
              <th id="listCenter">Footkicker coins</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>correct</td>
              <td id="listCenter">5</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>one goal away</td>
              <td id="listCenter">3</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>false but team correct</td>
              <td id="listCenter">1</dt>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>false and team false</td>
              <td id="listCenter">0</td>
          </tr>
      </table>
      <h2>Submit your own tip</h2>
      <div class="tableMargin">
          <p>You can click on a game you want and then you can type in your result as you think they are playing.
              After you have submitted your own tip, the game will be simulated an the result is displayed.
              This allows you to see whether the team you have bet on has won with your score or you have submitted a wrong tip.
              If you have made a correct tip and your team has won, you will receive a reward.
              The reward will be some footkicker coins which you can see at the end of the world cup
              how well you have tipped and you can compare your results with other people.
              The number of footkicker coins you get depends on various factors.</p>
